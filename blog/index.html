        <h3>Adding "Save As" feature</h3>

        <p>I used ChatGPT's Code GPT feature to generate Save As and Open code for Chromium.  <a href="../save-restore-html-experiments/Prompt for location to save to.html" target="_blank">Here is its answer as a standalone HTML file.</a></p>
        <p>I also had ChatGPT generate code to download part of the DOM. It's <a href="../save-restore-html-experiments/Download%20HTML.html" target="_blank">here as another standalone html file.</a></p>
        <p>I then had ChatGPT generate code to display a given directory's contents. It requires nodejs to run. It's <a href="../folder-browser/public/index.html/?path=./" target="_blank">here</a></p>

        <h3>That was brutal, but it kind of works.</h3>
        <p class="meta">After many hours of fiddling, I have the ability to <em>Save As</em> and <em>Open</em> in katex-editor, but gawd.</p>
        <p class="meta">25-05-15 14:52 (UTC-7) by Daniel</p>
        <p>It is insane that it took that long and was that fiddly.</p>
        <p>I still have next to no confidence in what I've done, and no record of the details of the implementation which I'm sure to need the next time I want to make a change.</p>
        <p>I definitely should try to save my development state, but how?</p>
        <p>Object oriented design would have helped, but javascript is very much NOT THAT by default.</p>
        <p>I'd need to identify a bunch of objects and get them into my head.</p>
        <p>For example, what are the visual extents of the &lt;html&gt; element?</p>
        <p>How do I even describe that?</p>
        <p>It's like I have to start with the browser window and model/demonstrate its behavior when resizing, clicking, maximizing, minimizing and so on.</p>
        <p>I'd need a complete set of "operations" along with a definition for each.</p>
        <p>For example, the "resizing" operation has "extents" which go from the minimum possible resizing horizontally and vertically using all the possible resizing methods.</p>
        <p>Resizing methods include resize by dragging top of window, resize by dragging lower right corner of window, resize by dragging upper left corner of window, etc.</p>
        <p>In my mind, I see a small web page or image that has a window with representative screen elements displayed and labelled so that the programmer will know what's what, but how to do this is a little iffy.</p>
        <p>Some options:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 2em;">
          <li>1) Take a screenshot of a couple actual katex editor sessions and then mark it up somehow.</li>
          <li>2) Draw a sort of schematic screen design and mark that up</li>
          <li>3) Use the CanvasAPI or SVG api to draw a schematic screen design including markups.</li>
          <li>4) Use inkscape to draw a schematic OR to mark up the screenshot from 1 OR use inkscape to do 2</li>
          <li>5) Use <a href="https://excalidraw.com/" target="_blank">Excalidraw</a> to draw a schematic and mark it up, then somehow render the Excalidraw as a local web page (maybe captured with Chromium Save As or SingleFile)</li>
          <li>6) Use hover-overs in katex editor's HTML to tell about each of its elements whilst highlighting them a) when the user hovers, or b) as some kind of dynamic mark-up displayable via some magic keystroke or javascript</li>
          <li>7) Find some open source javascripty library for drawing.  <a href="https://github.com/pflagerd/drawio" target="_blank">drawio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pflagerd/draw2d" target="_blank">draw2d</a> come to mind as does <a href="https://github.com/pflagerd/three.js" target="_blank">three.js</a></li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>I should probably also make explicit classes for each of the screen elements, because the current code sucks.</p>
        <p>I kind of like the idea of the mark-up being a sort of hidden code feature.</p>
